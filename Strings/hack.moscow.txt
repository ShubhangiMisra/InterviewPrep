If you want to write something else you can do it below (optional)

Russia is a beautiful place, with even more amazing people . I visited it during this summer for the FIFA WC 2018, for the first time.  Would love to hack with hackers from all over the world, in such a beautiful setting.

I am an undergrad with a zeal for entrepreneurship. 

I hope to have tremendous growth from this experience in terms of self development and domain expertise.

Eagerly waiting for the invitation !
